# Trithemius

Project to create an encrypted, peer-to-peer chat client using [libp2p](https://docs.rs/libp2p/latest/libp2p/index.html) and Rust.

Potential feature set:
- Listening on a Tor Onion service for incoming connections
- Connecting to other clients using Tor
- Peer discovery using Kademlia, MDNS and Rendezvous
- NAT traversal using Autonat, circuit-relay and DCUTR
- Library and minimal curses client

**NOTE**: This is just a project I'm doing for fun, please do not consider this code anything other than development code. Ever.
